  To install, you need to install mysql, clone the repo, and run `npm install` to install dependencies. From mysql in the command line, run source db/schema.sql to initialize the database.

  ## Usage
  Once dependencies are installed and the database is created, run npm start inside the terminal in the parent application folder. This will start the server and connect to your database
